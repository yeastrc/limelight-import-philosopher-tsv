Philosopher psm.tsv to Limelight XML Converter
===============================================

Use this program to convert the results of a philosopher analysis
to Limelight XML for import into Limelight.

Important: There is currently a bug in how Comet results are reported by philosopher. The issue can be
followed here: https://github.com/Nesvilab/philosopher/issues/251  Until fixed, you may encounter
errors or wrong data when converting Comet-based philosopher data.

Note:
- Uses the ``psm.tsv`` file generated by running ``philosopher report``
- If doing an open mod search, be sure to use --open-mod
- Supports both MSFragger and comet

How To Run
-------------
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/yeastrc/limelight-import-philosopher-tsv/releases).
2. Run the program ``java -jar philosopherTSV2LimelightXML.jar`` with no arguments to see the possible parameters. Requires Java 8 or higher.

Command line documentation
---------------------------

```
java -jar philosopherTSV2LimelightXML.jar [-hvV] [--open-mod] -f=<fastaFile>
                                          -m=<tsvFile> -o=<outFile>
                                          -p=<paramsFile>

Description:

Convert the results of a Philosopher analysis (MSFragger or Comet) to a Limelight XML file suitable
for import into Limelight.

Options:
  -p, --params=<paramsFile>  Path to the params file (either a comet or msfragger
                               params file).
  -f, --fasta-file=<fastaFile>
                             Full path to FASTA file used in the experiment. E.g.,
                               /data/yeast.fa
  -m, --psm-tsv=<tsvFile>    Path to ``psm.tsv`` file generated by ``philosopher
                               report``.
  -o, --out-file=<outFile>   Full path to use for the Limelight XML output file. E.
                               g., /data/my_analysis/crux.limelight.xml
  -v, --verbose              If this parameter is present, error messages will
                               include a full stacktrace. Helpful for debugging.
      --open-mod             If this parameter is present, the converter will run in
                               open mod mode. Mass diffs on the PSMs will be treated
                               as an unlocalized modification mass for the peptide.
  -h, --help                 Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version              Print version information and exit.
```
